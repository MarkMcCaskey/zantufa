Experiments with Lojban (specifically Zantufa)

PEG file taken from https://github.com/guskant/gerna_cipra .  Code here is also GPL2

## Plans:

* Get parsing working (It seems I either need to write my own PEG library or improve one of the existing ones)
* Update with improved error messages
* Adapt into subset for semantic experimentation
